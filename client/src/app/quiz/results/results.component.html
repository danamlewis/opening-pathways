        It’s ok if you realize that you are not ready to evolve your work in this direction. Feel free to read a few partner narratives for further inspiration before you go, or bookmark this site for future use. 

        It’s ok if you don’t have a patient partner! Save your responses, reflect, and check out some of the resource links, which might ultimately help you find your future patient partner. 

        If you have a patient partner already, or one in mind, here are some potential ways to follow up and show them your results:
        * Hi! This exercise was really helpful for me thinking through how we might work together, and I’d love to talk through it with you.
        * Hi, This exercise really helped me understand my strengths and goals, and that I need to understand yours better for this to work. I’m not sure exactly where to go from here, but maybe you have some ideas based on the attached responses?
        * Hi, This exercise walked me through my skills, commitments, and perspectives, and I’m realizing I’m probably not best positioned to partner with you in this work. I’m happy to be a resource and to try and help you find a better fit.
